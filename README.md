There is no true way to be 100% sure that any program is functional and secure, the best way is to test for the requirments set out to consider the program complete. Creating tests to cover requirements like making sure that variables are not null and meet certain length criteria should be checked. And the best practice to always follow is to use try catches and error exceptions almost everywhere so if something does go wrong that you do not except at least the program wont break completly and will exit safely instead.

The best way to interpret a users needs is to break it down into parts and to make sure to capture all of it. Users will ususally ask for a broad subject and it is up to the team to take that and make test from it so as to cover anything that would cause that to break. The test can only pass when you have assured the the users needs have been met in the program.

When designing software it is best to think about what the software is meant to do who it is meant to serve and what they would want from it. When developing software the software has a purpose it will be fulfilling something the is needed and for the software to fulfill that need it needs to pass tests that meet those needs. When creating software make sure it functions of course but that it meets the requirments to comlpete the need and if it deals with important private information it should be secure as well.
